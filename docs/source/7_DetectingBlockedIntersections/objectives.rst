Objectives
==========

In the past modules, you suppled the blocked intersections as a list to the compute_path
method. In this module, you will have the robot find the blocked intersections using the
ultrasonic rangefinder as it is navigating on the grid. As blocked intersections are
discovered, they will be added to the grid so that future path planning will take them
into account.
