Objectives
==========

The objectives for this unit are to:

* Learn how to use classes to store information about each intersection in the grid
* Learn how to represent blocked intersections.
* Learn how to represent the entire grid as a *graph* data structure to
  represent the connections between the intersections.
* Learn about using dictionaries to easily retrieve the intersection information
  using the row and column indicies.
* Learn and implement a basic algorithm for finding the shortest path between two
  intersections on the grid, even when some intersections might be blocked.
* Learn how to write, debug, and unit test your path planning code before adding
  the complexity of driving

Final Project
-------------

Given a set of intersections, generate paths between each of them, demonstrating
the correct operation without driving the robot. You will make use of sample data
and known solutions to test the operation as you write the code.
