Objectives
==========

The objectives for this module are to:

* Learn how to characterize a sensor to better understand how it behaves in
  the context in which you are using it.

* Learn how to use the reflectance sensors on your robot  to follow a line
  drawn or taped on a surface.

* Learn the use of conditional statements to keep the roboot on the line
  by making turns towards the line as the robot drifts off course.

* Learn about how to use proportional control to more precisely (more easily)
  keep the robot on the line without complex conditional statements.

* Get the robot to detect an intersection (line perpendicular to the circle)
  and turn around in place and start driving in the opposite direction.

* Learn how to make your code reusable through the use of object oriented design
  principles so that it can easily be incorporated   into the upcoming projects in
  this class.

Final Project
-------------

The final project for this module will be to have the robot drive around drawn
cicle a number of times, turning around at the intersection and continuing in
the opposite direction. You will compete with your classmates to see who's
robot can complete the challlenge in the fastest time.
