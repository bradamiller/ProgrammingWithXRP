.. note:: Should the use of AI tools be part of this course?

    This is an optional module, to help students learn how to work in a world where Artificial
    Intelligence tools are evolving faster than almost any other previous technology. Right
    now students can attempt to use these tools to potentially short circuit their learning
    which frightens many teachers. But the tools aren't going away, and everyone should
    learn to use them to their best advantage, and, in particular, understand how to evaluate
    the quality of the answers they provode.

Artifical Intelligence has become a very significant technology in the recent years and it
can be applied to coding. There are lots of opportunities to use AI to save time programming
but there are also possible pitfalls. In this module you will look at using AI to create
an alternate solution to some of the code you have already written.

The objectives are to:

* Learn a little about some of the current AI tools and how they might help make you more
  productive in your work.
* Learn how to constuct prompts for the tools to get the answers you need in the format you
  need them.
* Learn how to evaluate the quality and accuracy of the answers because they are often incorrect.
* Compare the programs you wrote by using your own knowledge and determination and those
  generated by the AI tools.
* Discuss the ethics of using tools like these to influence your learning experiences.
