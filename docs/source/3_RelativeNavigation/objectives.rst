Objectives - Module 3
=====================

The objectives for this module are to learn:

* How to navigate around a grid of lines.
* How to detect intersections.
* How to make turns at an intersection to the correct outgoing intersection.
* Drive in an assigned pattern through the grid and stop at the destination.

.. note::
    The projects in this module and in future modules are designed to allow
    you to reuse the line following classes from the previous module with
    little or no changes. If you implemented the classes as defined in the last 
    section, this module should be fairly easy to complete. If you have to reimplement and
    debug the line following algorithms again, completing this section will
    be much more difficult.

Final Project
-------------
You will program your robot to navigate around the grid in a prescribed pattern
such as a square, going through the correct intersections and ending at the
correct destination.
