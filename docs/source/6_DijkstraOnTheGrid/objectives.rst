Objectives
==========

In the last module, you ran the Dijkstra code to compute paths for driving through a
number of intersections. In this module you will use the Dijkstra class from the previous
module along with the code you've already written to get the robot to actually drive
to the computed path.

What you will learn:

* How to use two classes (Manhattan and Dijkstra) that share a common interface (the
  compute_path method) to be used interchangeably in your program.
